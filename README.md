# Directory-Based Cache Coherence Protocol
## Cache Protocol Simulator Implementation
Directory-based cache coherence protocol was implemented. The topology of processors' laypout is circle. It can calculate the latency of each instrcution. The way of mapping is direct mapping.
## Optimization
In this section, the way of mapping is changed to fully mapping to increase the private hitting rate.
